Marutham Mozhi is a deep learning-based image classification project developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras, with GPU acceleration via CUDA.
Designed for real-world applications, this model classifies images with high accuracy using Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Fully Connected layers.

The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook and is fully compatible with Google Colab or any local machine with NVIDIA GPU + CUDA support.

ðŸš€ Features

Important Notes
Ensure TensorFlow version supports GPU (TensorFlow 2.x usually supports it natively if CUDA drivers are installed).

A compatible CUDA and cuDNN version must be installed if running locally.

Training is significantly faster with GPU acceleration compared to CPU.
